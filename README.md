# Vasa Skeppet

## This is my first project done for code institute. Its an simple website for people intersted in the history of the Vasa ship.

The main goal with the website is to create a melting pot for people who are interested in the history of the Vasa ship and want to follow all the new reaserch that is made related to the Vasa Ship. As described the website is simble in its nature and should be seen as the site to sign up for and follow if you are on the hunt for new information about the Vasa ship.
